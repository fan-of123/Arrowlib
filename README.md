to the 0 people who used this, basically worthless as of 23w43a

Arrowlib is a datapack arrow, bow, and crossbow library that allows for the creation of custom arrows, bows, and crossbows with arbitrary NBT. Full documentation is in this document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_-P3fvMfTI4Aqx_ZUfECKSIA0Rn0Y37dr7MjS5f_pE/edit?usp=sharing

Features:

  -Built-in nbt tags for custom arrows that allow for toggleable infinity consumption and custom pickups (meaning, arrows fired and then picked up preserve their item NBT data)
  
  -Function tags for running commands at different points in the firing process (e.g tags for running commands when a player starts pulling a bow, or loads a crossbow, or when they shoot a bow, and many more.)

  -Several example custom bows and arrows (Not part of main library, see Example.zip)
